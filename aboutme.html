        <p>Hi, I am Bahar. Glad to see you here! I am currently a master's student at The University of Michigan studying UX Design. I am interested in photography and always take random photos of things I find beautiful or inspiring. Before studying UX, I was studying Industrial Design in Savannah, Georgia. I also enjoy watercoloring, walking, baking and cooking in addition to design and photography. </p>
        <p>I am from Baku, Azerbaijan but I have lived in many cities such as Ankara, Savannah, Greenville, Tempe and Ann Arbor. Travelling and living in different cities inspired me to capture memories in each place I go to and started my enthusiasm towards photography. Many of my photographs sky and urban themed. I also take photos of random objects that occupies a large portion of my phone's storage.</p>
